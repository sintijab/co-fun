                    Now I have started working with art collectors and discovered artifacts dating back to the 12th, 15 to 16th centuries that changed the way I mentally prepare for the longer depths and learn about myself. With machine learning it is possible to train visual language models with under 2B parameters that caption images in high detail that human eye does not have the patience to delve into.

                    One of the masterpieces I find deeply profound from the Heinrich Khunrath’s (1560-1605) book series Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae (The Amphitheatre of Eternal Wisdom), first published in 1595 and was illustrated by Hans Vredeman de Vries. It reminded me of one of my first paintings I used to draw as a child and the critique about being obsessed with the details.

                    This drawing beautifully summarises alchemy’s many branches, and is very practical. The perspective of this painting stretches into this feeling of immersion. The ensuing description of how such a room can be created follows the so-called inner or alchemical path.

                    To experience the three alchemical principles enter into the alchemical room. How does your mind change character depending on inner and outer circumstances? To what extent do you express your true will and open up to your essence? How is it expressed in your life?

                    Finally, meditate on the relation between these three principles; how the body is the mask of the soul, and how the soul is the center of your universe.

                    The room becomes real when you allow it to be real, by regularly being and working in it. Other archetypical forms can then also be invited and manifested, according to your needs and the nature of the work. You should strive to make it as natural to be there as with any room in your mundane house. This is reinforced by linking together the inner and outer world; if you sit down to meditate, then also enter into your inner alchemical room and sit down for meditation there as well.

                    Allow the instruments to play, and sit down on the pillar in the oratory. Experience the levels of your body; your physical body which sits or lies down, your inner subtle body that sits in the oratory, and the body which forms the alchemical room. Contemplate on how you utilize it, how much you listen to or ignore its needs, to what extent it holds these different parts.

                    Experience the weight of your body, its ability to focus in a bigger perspective of the matrix of life as corresponding with your being– that which gives focus and constitutes your existence, and that everything you experience occurs within this room. The right and left sides of the room then relate to the right and left side of your being, the active and passive part, the laboratory and the oratory.  Know that all this has to do with the salt principle.

                    Then turn your awareness towards the vital life force which implodes the whole of your being. Breathe deeply and allow yourself this true, free feeling, relax your body. Within yourself it is your higher or true self that keeps you connected with everything. To what extent do you open yourself up to this contact with your essence?

                    The ability to willingly create and hold on to inner images is sharply increased when being physically, mentally and emotionally relaxed. Thus, some kind of exercise can initiate this work with calm and steady breathing cycles, freediving is a great example of this.

                    A study of Khunrath’s illustration can then follow, where both the wholeness and certain details should be memorised. Thereafter, to symbolically step down into the subconscious, a downward going stair with ten steps can be visualised, which leads to a door. Try to see the stairs as clear as possible with your inner eye, and when you are ready, step down one step and notice the change in your whole being.

                    Enter and close the door behind you. At the end of the hall you will see the alchemical room, and its clarity increases as you walk closer, until you are standing in it.

                    To create a permanent form, seek to make the room as clear as possible. Walk toward the different sections, put on incense, sit down in prayer, play the instruments, feel the heat from the athanor.

                    ‘The Alchemist’s Laboratory’, is roughly divided into three areas; the oratory to the left, the laboratory to the right, and the musical and working table as well as the bed in the middle.
                </TextBase>
                <TextBase textStyle="initiative-descr" fontSize="17pt" fontWeight="regular" lineHeight="2" p=".5rem 0" textAlign="justify">
                    To the left, we see the alchemist in his oratory. The pentagram is both a symbol for the microcosm, the small world, and the man made divine, and is associated with geometry. The book on the right side displays an acrostic psalm, where each verse begins with the successive letters in Hebrew that creation is made possible through alchemy. Beneath the table are an hourglass and a skull under the inscription to the way of Nature, the principle of dissolution, and that even though alchemy promises eternal life, this nonetheless implies death of various forms.

                <TextBase textStyle="initiative-descr" fontSize="17pt" fontWeight="regular" lineHeight="2" p=".5rem 0" textAlign="justify">
                    The laboratory is on the right side of the room, where two pillars carry up an architrave. Beneath is the oven or athanor. This athanor is designated for works, where the three chemical principles are forced into separation through a process of calcination, fusion, sublimation, conjunction, and dry distillation of the prepared matter.
                </TextBase>
                <TextBase textStyle="initiative-descr" fontSize="17pt" fontWeight="regular" lineHeight="2" p=".5rem 0" textAlign="justify">
                    The two pillars that lift up the architrave are inscribed with the words RATIO (reason) and experience. They thus constitute the foundation for the pillars of severity and wisdom. Behind the pillar of reason we see a cooling device with water. This points out the importance of being able to cool down one's reason. The reasoning mind is important but cannot be universally prevailing, just as intellectual pride of alchemy makes no one an alchemist. A pair of bellows and tongs, to be used in the athanor, shall be a good balance between reason and experience that govern the work. A bucket with coal is placed in front of the pillar of experience, and alludes to the necessity of studying both classical alchemical works as well as nature.

                    In the middle, linking the oratory with the laboratory, we see a table with musical instruments (violin, lute, bell, etc.), writing materials, and a scale. Music, both craft and in its more divine aspect, thus has the ability to protect the alchemist from darkened thoughts and emotions during the hours of the symbolic night. An even important fact is the vibrations of music, which stands in relation with the alchemical art of transmuting or changing. When a thing is caused to change its vibration, it can move on to or transcend into a new condition. And the same applies to man, who through vibration can not only change thoughts and emotions, but also gain mystical and transcendent experiences. In everyday language, this is often described as charisma and people’s ability to change the atmosphere in a room just by their appearance.

                    Furthest away in the picture, we see an open door. The inscription on the arch above– Awake while sleeping – states what should ever be the focus of the alchemist. In a larger perspective this also alludes to the ever present state, constant weaving and dancing existing between all cycles of nature.
